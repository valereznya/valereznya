- 👋 Hi, I’m @valereznya
- 👀 I’m interested in making Cryptography great again, and bringing Instruction Set Randomization and KVM implementations like https://github.com/lkvm/lkvm into @QubesOS 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning QubesOS Core Admin and Client, RPC and Storage and how libvirt XML really isn't nice. Not just the XML, but also the libvirt. Consider https://github.com/lkvm/lkvm 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on design, amazing stunts with hackathon style code, overnight coding sessions putting pieces together and getting to know each other.
- 📫 How to reach me valereznya@pm.me
